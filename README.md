# borderline
This is a website that allows users to anonymously report 'bordxrline' sexual harrasment.
If several people report the same person, there is a very lighthearted outcome: We simply give the guy a call.
Anonymous reporting might sounds like a terrible idea at first, but we are talking about light, 'borderline' cases where no going to the police or public shaming is due.
The offender will not be hurt in any real sense, so the motivation to give a false report is practically 0.

The project uses the MEAN stack and bootstrap.
To run:
1. Install bower and npm dependencies.
2. Setup a mongodb server and point to it in server.js.
3. Run gulp.
