<p>Before we go further, we would like to take this oppurtunity to remind you that you are an honesty and trustworthy person. We expect nothing less then the honest truth, without exaggeration nor understatement. In the unlikely event that you are a person planning to give a false report, we urge you to stop NOW. Yes, the report will only reach the person you intend, but make no mistake - your report DOES have an impact and can trigger a chain reaction that you cannot forsee. Furthermore, you will be compromising the entire project, casting a shadow on the credability of all future reports. It's not too late. If you were planning on giving a false report - stop NOW.</p>
