              If anyone is sexually harassing you, you should consider going to HR or even the police. But what if someone is just making you feel uncomfortable? Punishing this person is <i>not</i> your only option. You can also <i>help</i> him by letting him know he's gone to far. We will help you help him while protecting both your and his privacy.
